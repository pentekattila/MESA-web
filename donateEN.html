            We feel it is important to speak honestly and thrutfully about
            everything. That's why we think it's essential to place what we do
            in the right context. And what we do is not the music of servants,
            but rather the service of musicians. As musicians, we have chosen to
            praise God. We want to do this in a way that is attractive and even
            for those who are not part of a christian circle. This can only be
            achieved by working at the highest possible musical level. We truly
            want to bring quality and something new into this musical dimension.
            We humbly but firmly believe this; but to accomplish all of this, we
            also need support. If you love what we do and would like to
            contribute, here is how you can support us.

                    There is no doubt that we would like to seal our Ragtime
                    project with an album. However, an album would not merely
                    mean a tangible CD. The album actually encompasses
                    everything that comes with it: a studio-quality recording of
                    these songs, but it also means that doors will open to
                    online streaming platforms. If you would like to hold this
                    album in your hands or listen to us on Spotify or other
                    platforms, you can support us in making this happen.

                    It was never a question for us that MÉSA should be socially
                    uplifting. That's why we want to bring good news, happiness,
                    and music even to places where there are rarely such
                    opportunities. We want to reach out to financially destitute
                    or socially disadvantaged congregations and communities
                    where extraordinary events cannot otherwise be created. Of
                    course, this also entails costs, but our goal is to cover
                    these costs from the donations of our wealthier supporters.
                    If it's important to you that we reach out to those living
                    in isolation, hardship or loneliness, then you can support
                    us in this.

                    Every creative process involves and requires a few important
                    tools, whether it be a microphone, notation software, a
                    stand, or an instrument. But it's not just the creation that
                    has important tools; performances also have essential
                    equipment. If you love what we do, you can support us in
                    acquiring these tools.
